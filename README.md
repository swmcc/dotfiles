# swmcc dotfiles

My kitchen sink of handy utility scripts that I have.

## components

- **xxx.xxx.xxx/** are server names and follow the internal structure of the server
- **.app/** are application specific and/or contain scripts to aid me in using the app
- **bin/** should work on any linux/mac type system
- **app/** software specific but requires some knowledge to put the commands in the right file

## adding

As time goes on I will add more to this but I am lazy. It will probably take a while for it to be really useful.

## installing

Some dotfile repos have a nice handy 'boostrap' command. This one doesn't. 
I might add one someday but to be fair it would take too much time and require a good bit of effort for little gain.
However, you never know....
