## Description

My kitchen sink of handy utility scripts & configurations that I have that aid
my workflow.

### What are dotfiles?

dotfiles are files in your home directory that begin with a dot, or full-stop
character. This indicates to the operating system that they are hidden files,
used to set configuration settings for tools like vim, or shells such as bash
and zsh to name a few.

### Why keep them in a git repo?

By storing my dotfiles in a Git repository, I'm able to use them on any
OS X or Linux machine with Internet access.

This means that in addition to gaining the ability to revert back to a
known-working setup should I misconfigure any files, I will also be able
to work in an environment that I have customised myself. On almost any
workstation or server, I am a simple git clone away from the familiarity of
my customisations.
