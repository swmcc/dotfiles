# swmcc dotfiles

My kitchen sink of handy utility scripts that I have. 
It is organised in a 'swmcc' type fashion, that is - it makes sense to me :)

## components

- **xxx.xxx.xxx/** are server names and follow the internal structure of the server
- **.app/** are application specific that the application will read natively
- **bin/** should work on any linux/mac type system 
- **app/** software specific but requires some knowledge to put the commands in the right file

## adding

As time goes on I will add more to this but I am lazy.
